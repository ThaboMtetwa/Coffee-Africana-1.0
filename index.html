        <h2>Why Is African Coffee Good?</h2>
        <p>Much of Africa lies across the “bean belt” which has the perfect growing conditions for coffee. Coffee production is situated along the African Great Lakes, where fertile soil, cool climate, and numerous highlands makes it ideal for cultivating the Arabica coffee species.
            This region is known for producing one of the fruitiest coffees in the world. African coffees are typically characterized by bright acidity with wine-like, floral, and fruity flavors. This can range from citrus, berries, bergamot, and even hints of jasmine.
        </p>
        <p>Coffee experts have long since recognized Ethiopia and Kenya for their premium-quality, specialty grade coffee varieties such as Typica, SL-28, Kenya AA coffee, and the famed Gesha varietal.</p>
        <p>Countries such as Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Burundi also produce uniquely flavored coffees and are steadily placing high for specialty coffee lovers. Other regions, including Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda produce mainly Robusta varieties.</p>
