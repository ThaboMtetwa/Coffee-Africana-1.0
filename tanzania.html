    <h1>Tanzanian Peaberry Coffee</h1>
    <p>Regarded for its medium roast flavor that emits an aroma with floral notes that are accompanied by hints of citrus, pineapple, and coconut taste.  The aroma of a Tanzania coffee may exhibit a rustic note and sometimes a brown bread sweetness. The aftertaste lingers with a slight suggestion of East African wildness.</p>
    <p>The acidity levels of Tanzania coffee are slightly muted compared to Kenyan coffee, are also less consistent with a milder body. Although the fruit and acidity are more understated they still shine brightly. Ground, dry Tanzania coffee may present a sweet molasses fragrance that is slightly floral with notes of apple fruit.</p>
    <p>Mbinga is sourced from family-owned farms organized around Soochak Bush and Tropex, two companies that began collaborating in 1999 to improve coffee production in the Mbinga district of Tanzania. The Mbinga district is located in the southwestern corner of the Ruvuma region and shares a border with Mozambique and Lake Nyasa (also called Lake Malawi), one of the African Great Lakes known for its rich diversity of wildlife. Soochak Bush and Tropex provide critical support to the small producers, including the operation of a dry mill and logistics to transport and export coffee from the port city of Dar es Salaam, which is more than 1000 kilometers from the Mbinga district. To ensure improved post-harvest processing, Sobchak Bush and Tropex have rehabilitated 8 existing wet mills, built 13 new centralized wet mills, and another 8 micro-wet mills. Cherries are hand sorted, soaked so floaters can be removed, de-pulped, fermented for 2 to 3 days, washed in channels, dried on raised beds, and then sorted again at the dry mill. Farmers are paid for parchment during the harvest and paid a share of profits after export.</p>
